# 决策记录

2026-09-26：优先审计 D 盘，但采用 WSL 已存在的作者复现资产作为服务器科研输入。证据：D相关25文件为早期原型；WSL含数十个实验组、多seed模型、原始轨迹和协议。两个工作树保留，既有修改不重置。避免从原型重复昂贵训练。

2026-09-26：复制冻结源码和原始绝对路径兼容链接，不修改已登记源码。新部署文件单列。source SHA、dirty patch 与迁移后的SHA重新登记，不能把新快照提交当原实验提交。

2026-09-26：保留四个完成浅树模型与中断训练，但不静默拼接两台主机的测时。恢复策略先基于源码和未完成边界审计登记；可能需重新完整计量参与排名的配对块，重复预算单列。

2026-09-26：长期控制器只允许gpt-5.5/xhigh，单实验串行，4h wall上限、3.1GB服务内存、48次API/日、每轮6次、150万报告token/日。预算耗尽等待下一个UTC日，不能换模型。连续失败进入诊断。服务器重启由systemd恢复。

2026-09-26追加：服务器已逐文件核验vehicle seed1训练内复选10个条件、160回合、12640控制步，3/4树候选行为始终H25，另1个使用H25/H45且成本更高，最终按冻结规则选择fixed。该保存策略不可能满足逐seed回合内自适应门槛；这不是独立test结论。优先诊断候选退化/覆盖和测时噪声，避免仅完成剩余长训练就误称成功。未读取validation/test结果。



2026-09-26用户覆盖：取消所有API调用、token、API费用日上限，去掉本地单请求输出token上限。仅使用GPT-5.5/xhigh；每轮最多12次调用后保存状态，5秒后继续；保留实验公平预算、单任务执行、实验超时、失败退避、资源限制。旧48次/日与150万token/日规则作废。

## 2026-09-26 latency-tree recovery/migration amendment

Decision: freeze a recovery/migration amendment before any resumed timing-sensitive latency-tree work. The historical preregistration is preserved unchanged. WSL and AWS wall-time measurements must not be mixed for ranking; any timing-influenced selection requires a whole same-host paired AWS block. Behaviorally fixed trees are fixed-H comparators, not adaptive policies. Adaptive claims now require actually used multiple horizons plus inherited safety/non-inferiority gates and paired cost or same-host timing benefit. The current vehicle training-selection evidence is development-only: seed0 is timing-noise-susceptible fixed-H25 behavior, seed1 is fixed, and only seed2 is a switching candidate requiring independent validation.

<!-- pendulum-inventory-interpretation-20260926 -->
## 2026-09-26 pendulum inventory finalized

UTC: 2026-09-26T12:23:05.106778+00:00. Metadata-only inventory `experiments/bohn2021_aws/pendulum_inventory_metadata.py` completed with no simulations, no validation reads, and no sealed-test reads. pendulum_s0 is a completed training artifact (selected `g1_c10`, 66 completed markers). pendulum_s1 is a stale/interrupted threshold-reference run (progress {'episodes': 1, 'expected': 12, 'pid': 1694525, 'steps': 13}, dead PIDs [1694525], tmp files 1). pendulum_s2 is absent/unstarted at train root. This is not control-performance evidence. The partial WSL pendulum_s1 timing-sensitive work must be counted as interrupted budget and must not be spliced into AWS timing objectives. Final test remains sealed/unauthorized; validation64 remains unopened for post-amendment model selection.

Decision: treat pendulum_s1 as failed/interrupted historical work and pendulum_s2 as unstarted unless future metadata contradicts this. Formal all-seed pendulum latency-tree evidence requires an AWS-only fresh recovery block or an explicitly vehicle-only development scope; behaviorally fixed trees remain fixed-H comparators.

<!-- post-amendment-vehicle-freeze-diagnostic-20260926 -->
## 2026-09-26 post-amendment vehicle freeze diagnostic

UTC: 2026-09-26T12:34:18.073579+00:00. Metadata-only diagnostic completed with no simulations, no validation64 content/outcome read, and no sealed-test read. Vehicle learned candidates s0/s1/s2 and fixed-H comparator inventory were hashed. Next actual experiment is frozen as a non-formal AWS-only vehicle smoke paired timing/control block versus fixed H25; formal validation remains unopened and whole two-task validation remains blocked by pendulum_s1/s2 recovery. Artifacts: `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/post_amendment_vehicle_freeze_diagnostic/raw.json`, `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/post_amendment_vehicle_freeze_diagnostic/summary.md`, `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/post_amendment_vehicle_freeze_diagnostic/vehicle_development_timing_freeze.json`. New artifacts require backup before unique formal evidence accumulates.

<!-- vehicle-development-smoke-pairing-20260926 -->
## 2026-09-26 vehicle development smoke pairing

UTC: 2026-09-26T12:51:06.985559+00:00. Non-formal AWS-only vehicle smoke completed on `vehicle_smoke_bank` with 24 episodes and 1764 control steps. Replay passed=True; validation_accessed=false; test_accessed=false. Use only for engineering readiness/timing-boundary checks, not validation/model selection. Artifacts: `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/vehicle_development_smoke_pairing/raw.json`, `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/vehicle_development_smoke_pairing/summary.md`. New artifacts require backup before formal evidence.

<!-- vehicle-smoke-artifact-digest-20260926 -->
## 2026-09-26 vehicle smoke artifact digest

UTC: 2026-09-26T12:56:46.885426+00:00. Metadata-only audit of the non-formal AWS vehicle smoke outputs completed. Top-level completed hash check passed=True; episode completed hash check passed=True; independent replay passed=True with 12 pairs. Seed2 H35 trigger count=8 and intervals=[{'episode_index': 2, 'repeat': 0, 'case': 1, 'start_step': 14, 'end_step': 16, 'length': 3}, {'episode_index': 2, 'repeat': 0, 'case': 1, 'start_step': 31, 'end_step': 31, 'length': 1}, {'episode_index': 13, 'repeat': 1, 'case': 1, 'start_step': 14, 'end_step': 16, 'length': 3}, {'episode_index': 13, 'repeat': 1, 'case': 1, 'start_step': 31, 'end_step': 31, 'length': 1}]. No simulations were run; validation_accessed=false; test_accessed=false. This remains engineering/development evidence only, not model selection or reproduction evidence. Artifacts: `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/vehicle_smoke_artifact_digest/raw.json`, `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/vehicle_smoke_artifact_digest/summary.md`, `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/vehicle_smoke_artifact_digest/completed.json`. New digest artifacts require backup before formal evidence.

<!-- vehicle-validation-gate-freeze-20260926 -->
## 2026-09-26 vehicle validation gate freeze

UTC: 2026-09-26T13:05:41.673579+00:00. Metadata-only no-validation gate frozen at `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/vehicle_validation_gate_20260926/vehicle_validation_gate_20260926.json`. Validation bank content opened=false; sealed test content opened=false; simulations=0. Gate froze 42 unique rollout arms, 2688 planned validation episodes over case indices only, and 12 bounded shards. Vehicle learned s0 and s1 are preclassified as fixed/nonadaptive by structure; only s2 is structurally switching. External backup of this new gate is required before formal validation64 rollout; final test remains unauthorized.

<!-- vehicle-validation64-shard-runner-dryrun-20260926 -->
## 2026-09-26 vehicle validation64 shard runner dry-run

UTC: 2026-09-26T13:16:00.900755+00:00. New runner `experiments/bohn2021_aws/vehicle_validation64_shard_runner.py` dry-run completed with validation_accessed=false, test_accessed=false, simulations=0. It verified the frozen gate, source/model/policy hashes, bank stat metadata without opening validation/test content, and formal-run backup-proof requirements. Artifacts: `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/vehicle_validation64_shard_runner_dryrun_20260926/dry_run.json`, `research_artifacts/aws_diagnostics/vehicle_validation64_shard_runner_dryrun_20260926/summary.md`. Runner and dry-run outputs now require external backup before any validation64 content access.

<!-- post-dryrun-backup-blocker-audit-20260926 -->
## 2026-09-26 post-dry-run backup blocker audit

UTC: 2026-09-26T13:21:03+00:00. Metadata-only blocker audit completed with no validation/test bank content opened and no simulations. The dry-run/gate/runner hashes remain consistent, but no adequate post-dry-run external backup proof is present in the repository. A new backup request was written at `research_artifacts/aws_backup_proofs/REQUEST_POST_DRYRUN_BACKUP_20260926T132103.json`. Formal vehicle validation64 shard0 remains blocked until the supervisor provides a verified external backup proof with `backup_verified=true`, `remaining_changed_files=0`, commit, GitHub release asset/download SHA256, runner/gate hashes, and dry-run artifact hashes. Sealed test remains closed.

<!-- vehicle-validation64-shard-complete-20260926-shard00 -->
## 2026-09-26 vehicle validation64 shard 00

UTC: 2026-09-26T14:35:01.431574+00:00. Formal vehicle validation shard completed with validation_accessed=true, test_accessed=false, episodes=224, control_steps=19832. Artifacts: `research_artifacts/aws_formal_validation/vehicle_validation64_20260926/shard00/raw.json`, `research_artifacts/aws_formal_validation/vehicle_validation64_20260926/shard00/summary.md`. This is shard-level validation evidence only; final sealed test remains unauthorized.

<!-- vehicle-validation64-shard00-audit-20260926 -->
## 2026-09-26 vehicle validation64 shard00 audit

UTC: 2026-09-26T14:40:37+00:00. Post-run audit of formal shard00 completed with validation_accessed=true (reading shard outputs), sealed test accessed=false, simulations=0, training steps=0. Shard00 has 224 episodes and 19832 control steps, within the declared 224/33600 budget. Completed hash audit passed=True; episode trace/hash audit passed=True; aggregate replay checks passed=True. Learned candidates in shard00: s0 fixed H25 (408 steps), s1 fixed H25 (390 steps), s2 used H25/H35 ({'25': 287, '35': 60}) with 18 switches. This is only 1/12 validation evidence and not final model selection. New formal evidence requires external backup before shard01; request written at `research_artifacts/aws_backup_proofs/REQUEST_BACKUP_AFTER_VALIDATION64_SHARD00_20260926T144050.json`. Sealed test remains closed.

<!-- vehicle-validation64-shard00-audit-v2-schema-repair-20260926 -->
## 2026-09-26 vehicle validation64 shard00 audit-v2 schema repair

UTC: 2026-09-26T14:45:06+00:00. Corrective audit-v2 classified audit-v1's nonzero exit as a registry schema false negative: the shard run registry records `commit_sha=523ec69d0986ebde3f10f24fd6dd8ad7df30e1f9` while audit-v1 required a `git_commit` field. Substantive v1 checks were complete and passed: completed-hash audit=True, episode trace/hash audit=True, aggregate replay=True, schedule mismatches=[]. validation_accessed=true because already-created shard00 results were read; sealed test accessed=false; simulations=0; training steps=0. Shard00 remains only 1/12 validation evidence, not model selection. External backup covering shard00, audit-v1, audit-v2, docs, registries and backup requests is required before shard01.
